Testing Pastebin per @frkbmb's suggestion.
 
Trying to write a #Yahtzee game in #JavaScript. Does this pseudocode look appropriate? I don't understand Yahtzee (or almost any other game). I want to make sure I have all the logic right before I start coding.
 
Yahtzee
2 players
 
Player1 = human
Player 2 = computer
 
Text input = "Type your name"
Player1.name = textbox input
 
Set values of all CategoryBox variables = "null"
 

 
Player chooses to score or roll again
       
If (player chooses to roll again) {
        Player chooses 0-5 dice as "keepers"
                If Player clicks on a die, remove d.x from array DiceRolled
        Player clicks "roll"
                generate random value 1-6 for each die remaining in array
        }
 
If (player chooses to score) {
        Upper Section: Mark numbers in appropriate score boxes
                (more game logic that I don't understand yet)
        Lower Section:
                Scan over collection to see if certain combinations of values exist
                Re-arrange array by numerical order value
                        If three dice have same value, "3 of a kind"
                                set "ThreeOfAKind" = Total values of all five dice
                        If four dice have same value, "4 of a kind"
                                set "FourOfAKind = Total values of all five dice
                        If three dice have one value and two dice have another value,
                                set "FullHouse" = 25
                        If dice show any sequence of four numbers
                                If dice[i]-[i+3] = value, value+1, value+2, value+3
                                set "Small Straight" = 30
                        If dice show sequence of five numbers
                                If dice[i]+[1+4]= value, value+1, value+2, value+3,
                                         value+4,
                                or
                                        if array Dice = [1, 2, 3,4,5]
                                        or
                                        if array Dice = [2,3,4,5,6]    
                                set "LargeStraight"=40
                        If (die1===die2 && die2===die3 && die3===die4 &
                        die4===die5 && die5===die6)
                                Set "Yahtzee" = 50
                                       
        Yahtzee bonus:
                If there is already a Yahtzee, in a previous turn
                        add 100 point Yahtzee bonus
                        set "YahtzeeBonus" = "checked"
                        (take bonus chip?)
                        play Joker Rules
 
        Joker Rules:
                Determine appropriate UpperSection box
                        if  box is empty
